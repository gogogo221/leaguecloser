(do not have a user prompt this program should run the background)

open file with picture of top bar

have to check to see if league of legends client is open 
    check by taking screen shots and comparing to picture of topbar
    should probably do this every few seconds not every frame 
    compare picture of top bar with screenshots of computer

if league client is open need to find the X and click on it
    (how do i orient the click relative to where the top bar is so i can click on x)
then find the exit button (the are you sure button) and click on it
    (same problem with the x but harder)
    take the coordinates of the x button and add by a set ammount since dimensions are always the same
